# Train-Scheduler using Firebase

**Overview:** Using JavaSript and Bootstrap, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates the form's information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
